# react-native
Some students have wanted some additional examples of React Native code that corresponds to previous React code that has been developed.  This repository provides you with the [Cities learning activity(cities.js) (written in the class form) from a prior learning activity in React Native and the [Todo List](todo.js) (written with functions) from a previous activity.  These should help you to complete the React Native lab.  You need to change something to get credit for the lab though.  You cant just turn these in.
